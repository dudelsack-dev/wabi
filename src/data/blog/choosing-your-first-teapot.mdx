# Choosing Your First Japanese Teapot

The Japanese teapot — **kyusu** (急須) — is more than a brewing vessel. It is a daily companion, a tactile ritual, a bridge between you and the tea leaf. Choosing your first one is a meaningful decision.

## Types of Clay

The clay determines everything: how the tea tastes, how the pot ages, what it feels like in your hand.

### Tokoname (常滑)
The most popular choice for a first kyusu. Tokoname clay is rich in iron oxide, which reacts with the tannins in green tea to produce a smoother, sweeter cup. The unglazed interior absorbs tea oils over time, seasoning like a cast iron pan.

### Banko (萬古)
From Mie prefecture, Banko clay is prized for its heat retention. It is slightly porous, making it excellent for sencha and gyokuro. The purple-brown color is distinctive and warm.

### Arita / Hasami Porcelain
If you drink a variety of teas and want a neutral vessel that won't absorb flavors, porcelain is the way to go. These kyusu are glazed inside and out — easy to clean, elegant, and versatile.

## The Side Handle

Most Japanese teapots have a side handle (yokode) rather than the overhead handle common in Western teapots. This design allows a natural, one-handed pouring motion that gives precise control over the pour.

Hold the handle with your right hand, place your thumb or finger on the lid, and pour in a smooth, steady motion. The angle of the side handle matters — try to find one that feels intuitive in your grip.

## Size Matters

Japanese teapots are typically smaller than Western ones — most hold between 200ml and 360ml. This is intentional:

- Smaller volumes brew more concentrated, flavorful tea
- Multiple short infusions reveal different layers of flavor
- The intimacy of a small pot encourages presence and attention

For a single person, 200-250ml is ideal. For two people sharing tea, 300-360ml works well.

## Built-in Strainer

Look at the strainer type:

- **Sasame** — a ceramic strainer built into the spout, with fine holes. Best for most teas.
- **Obi-ami** — a stainless steel mesh band around the interior. Good for very fine teas like deep-steamed sencha.
- **Ceramic ball filter** — removable, easy to clean.

## Our Recommendation

For a first kyusu, we suggest a Tokoname teapot in the 250-300ml range with a sasame strainer. It will serve you beautifully for years, growing richer with every brew. The one we carry — the Tokoname Kyusu by Yamada Takeshi — is an excellent starting point.

Begin with good leaves, fresh water just off the boil, and patience. The teapot will teach you the rest.
