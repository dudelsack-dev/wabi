# Japanese Kitchen Essentials

A well-equipped Japanese kitchen is not about having many tools — it is about having the right ones. Each item is chosen with intention, designed to do one thing beautifully, and built to last.

## The Knife (包丁)

If you invest in only one thing, let it be a good knife. A Japanese **hocho** is thinner, harder, and sharper than most Western knives. The most versatile style is the **santoku** — literally "three virtues" — which handles vegetables, fish, and meat with equal grace.

Look for:
- **Aogami (Blue Steel)** or **Shirogami (White Steel)** — traditional carbon steels that take an extraordinary edge
- A blade length of 165-180mm for general use
- A **wa-handle** (Japanese-style wooden handle) in magnolia or ho wood

A carbon steel knife requires care — dry it after use, oil it occasionally — but rewards you with a sharpness that stainless steel rarely achieves.

## The Cutting Board (まな板)

Pair your knife with a **hinoki** (Japanese cypress) cutting board. Hinoki is:
- Naturally antibacterial
- Gentle on knife edges (softer than bamboo or hardwood)
- Beautifully fragrant when wet
- Self-healing — minor cut marks close over time

A good hinoki board should be at least 3cm thick. It will lighten and develop character with use.

## The Clay Pot (土鍋)

The **donabe** is the heart of Japanese comfort cooking. This clay pot goes directly on the flame and is used for:
- Hot pot (nabe) in winter
- Perfect rice
- Slow-simmered soups and stews

Iga-yaki donabe from Mie prefecture are particularly prized — the porous clay retains heat beautifully and releases far-infrared rays that enhance umami.

## The Mortar (すり鉢)

A **suribachi** — the ridged ceramic mortar — is essential for:
- Grinding sesame seeds (the foundation of many dressings)
- Making shira-ae (tofu-based dressing)
- Preparing miso-based sauces

Unlike a smooth mortar and pestle, the grooved interior of a suribachi grips and shreds. It is a tool of texture and transformation.

## The Iron Kettle (鉄瓶)

A **tetsubin** does double duty: it boils water beautifully (iron enriches the water with minerals) and serves as a striking centerpiece. The classic arare (hailstone) pattern is functional — it increases surface area for more even heating.

## Building Your Kitchen

Start with the knife and cutting board. Add the donabe when you're ready to explore one-pot cooking. The suribachi and tetsubin come when your practice deepens.

There is no rush. A Japanese kitchen is built slowly, piece by piece, each addition considered and welcomed. Like the objects themselves, the process is part of the beauty.
